    <h4>My Proudest Projects</h4>

        I think it's better to use my online 
        character design instead of my real looks.

    <div class="myproject">
                <p class="project">There's not much to talk about myself before I was back in my own country. Life of Chinese students are boring, all we do every day was go to school, do our homework, and sleep. Nothing special really happened to me. If there's something I'm proud of myself, it's probably my video translation works in the fansub groups I've joined since 2021.</p>
                <p class="project">What's a fansub group?</p> 
                <blockquote  class="project" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub#:~:text=The%20same%20series%20or%20episode%20may%20be%20subtitled,fansubs%20that%20are%20more%20susceptible%20to%20errors.%20">
                    A fansub (short for fan-subtitled) is a version of a foreign film or foreign television program, typically anime or dorama which has been translated by fans (as opposed to an officially licensed translation done by paid professionals) and subtitled into a language usually other than that of the original.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="project">These fansub groups mainly make contents of Minecraft YouTubers such as BadBoyHalo and Skeppy, and the part I play is the translator, whose job is <q>to translate and ensure the translational quality of the script and signs respectively. </q></p>
                <p class="project">I was so devoted to this because I was obsessed with Minecraft YouTubers and eagerly wanted to do something for them, Translating and reposting their videos was the best way I could think of. A lot of people don't have access to websites like YouTube in my country, and doing this helps both YouTubers and the audiences. </p>
                <p class="project">I made more than 50 videos with them in the past 2 years. I've made a lot of friends online during this process and improved my English a little bit by doing this. I even started my own account. Until this day, I still work for three of those fansub groups.</p>
